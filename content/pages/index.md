      <div style="text-align: center">***I’m Shreyas***, Over the past few
      years, I’ve worked hard to build a solid foundation in web application
      development, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain
      technologies. Along the way, I’ve also embraced opportunities to teach and
      mentor, which has been both challenging and incredibly rewarding.My
      projects reflect my passion for problem-solving and innovation. Whether
      it’s developing a **Image classification** using VGG16 and Google Colab,
      creating a **sentiment analysis** web app, or building a
      **blockchain-based transaction tracking system for an NGO**, I’ve always
      enjoyed pushing myself to learn and grow\.Outside of coding, I’ve explored
      creative outlets like technical blog writing  and sharing unique content
      on social media. I believe in blending creativity with technical skills to
      create impactful solutions and meaningful connections.This journey has
      been an exciting mix of challenges, learning experiences, and personal
      growth, and I’m eager to see where it takes me next!</div>
